# Libra - The Balancing Framework 
Libra is a framework designed to ease creating and managing big sets of configurations. The ultimate goal is to provide tools that will allow others to design, build and configure complex systems without writing code. 



## Core concepts 
- extensibility is a king. Creating new field or adding resource type should be easy. We don't care where changes are coming from and where they go. Where and how configuration are stored should be irrelevant.
